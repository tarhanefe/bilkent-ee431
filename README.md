## Assignment 1

This assignment explores the basics of digital communication, focusing on the preparation of signals for transmission. It includes tasks such as uniform and nonuniform quantization, and LZW (Lempel-Ziv-Welch) encoding. The tasks involve analyzing the effects of quantization on signal representation, calculating error probabilities, and implementing the LZW algorithm for text compression.

## Assignment 2

In this assignment, digital modulation techniques are explored, focusing on signal spaces, orthogonal projection, and modulation using methods like PAM and PSM. The tasks include finding orthonormal basis functions, binary modulation with pulse amplitude modulation, and calculating the error probability for the received sequence. Practical implementation in MATLAB includes evaluating signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and probability of error.
